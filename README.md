# Advanced Text Analysis with SpaCy and Scikit-Learn

This notebook was originally prepared for the workshop [Advanced Text Analysis with SpaCy and Scikit-Learn](http://dhweek.nycdh.org/event/advanced-text-analysis-with-spacy-and-scikit-learn/), presented as part of NYCDH Week 2017. Here, we try out features of the SpaCy library for natural language processing. We also do some statistical analysis using from the scikit-learn library.
